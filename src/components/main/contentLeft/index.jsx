				<Topics>hello world</Topics>
				<Subtopics> A bit about me&#33;</Subtopics>
				<TextElements>
					Iâ€™m passionate about <b>body expression and visual arts </b>
					since I was a child. Over the years I got involved with
					<b> Desing</b> and, of course,
					<b> programming</b>, let me tell you that I was
					<b> blown away</b> by every aspect&#33;
				</TextElements>
				<TextElements>
					When I started working as a designer I always felt like I
					could do more. I kept imagining how incredible it would be
					to be able tos
					<b> make applications that go beyond the visual stimulus</b>
					and people could actually interact with them.
				</TextElements>
				<TextElements>
					That way, when I had my first contact with programming,
					<b> everything fell into place</b> and I'm falling more and
					more in love with the limitless possibilities it presents
					me!

					Now that you know a little about me, <b>lets chat&#33; </b>
					Here are some socials that we can connect, feel free to talk
					to me.
